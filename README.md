## 🧠 What This Repository Covers

### 🔹 C Programming
I learned **C programming** by implementing and practicing a wide range of programs, starting from beginner level and gradually moving to advanced concepts.

This includes:

- Logic building problems  
- Pattern printing programs  
- Arrays  
- Strings  
- Functions  
- Recursion  
- Pointers  
- Structures  
- File handling  
- Mini projects

### 🔹 C++ Pattern Programming
This repository also contains a **wide range of pattern printing programs implemented in C++**, which are:

### 🔹 C++ STL (Standard Template Library)
This repository also includes a **complete and practical C++ STL tutorial**, covering the **most frequently used STL containers and algorithms**, along with examples and explanations.

The STL section covers:

- `vector`
- `list`
- `deque`
- `stack`
- `queue`
- `priority_queue` (max heap & min heap)
- `set`
- `multiset`
- `unordered_set`
- `map`
- `multimap`
- `unordered_map`
- STL algorithms such as:
  - `sort()` (with custom comparator)
  - `next_permutation()`
  - `__builtin_popcount()`
  - `min_element()`
  - `max_element()`
